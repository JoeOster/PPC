The Proper printer controller, or PPC for short, is a program which can control 3D printers running Marlin (like Creality’s printers). This utilizes the Marlin Instrument Drivers for LabVIEW https://github.com/properprinting/MID which are needed to run the software. The goal of this software is to make a platform for controlling and testing 3D printers and make custom applications. LabVIEW is a graphical programming environment often used for controlling instruments. LabVIEW has got a community edition which can be downloaded for free for personal use. The UI uses the JKI design palette https://resources.jki.net/design-palette

This program comes with a binary package (executable) which can run without LabVIEW, but needs the LabVIEW Runtime Engine and VISA drivers.
